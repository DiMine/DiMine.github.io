the gfuel thing (only works with streamelements when ed is offline)
  
  
  
# STARTER BOT  
#### &gt;restart  
If the PogpegaBot breaks, use this to restart it. (also this is disabled because the part that crashes is a different script and everything in this bot is in try catches so it hopefully shouldnt break :COPIUM:  
  
#### &gt;shock  
Restarts the script for the bot that triggers the osu bot  
 
  
# BOOLIN BOT
Half the time this bot isnt even on, and it only has one trigger.  
If MrDutchBoi sends a message that contains "Boolin ?" the bot will wait 3 seconds then say Boolin
  
  
# COMING SOON if i ever get around to it  
- Organize the commands on this page alphabetically  
- Put the led/servo commands into a separate script so the main script can run without sudo  
- Counters for how many times each command has been used
- Total pogpega count for the bot (but i need someone's chatterino logs)
- Gamba with Pogpegas  
- Temporary increase in pogpegas when the gfuel message shows up (but how to do it without decimals)
- Copypasta library (added, but still needs to have fuller functionality)
- Google search integration? (would be hard to moderate though)
- Make the rgb led use full color spectrum (i think its possible i just dont know how)
- Discord version of pogpegabot eventually (technically its already there i just need to add command triggers)
- Chat logs

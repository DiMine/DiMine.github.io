# MAIN BOT
All of the commands work with Pogpega, Pogpega IceCold, Pogpega SoSnowy, Pogpega  IceCold at the beginning of the message.
 
### ONLINE CHAT COMMANDS  
The only time this bot ever says anything in online chat is when someone donates $7.27.  
If you see the bot respond to a command in online chat, please tell a mod to time it out until stream is done.  
 
 
### LED COMMANDS (these work in online chat but the bot wont say anything) 
There are 4 LEDs connected to my pi:

- Red - Lights up for 5 seconds when I get pinged using >ping  
- Green - Controlled by &gt;led on and &gt;led off

If MrDutchBoi sends a message that contains "Boolin ?" the bot will wait 3 seconds then say Boolin
  
  
# COMING SOON if i ever get around to it  
- The restart command doesn't show the output of the pogpegabot so i have to fix that somehow
- Step counter
- Counters for how many times each command has been used
- Markov generator
- Auto restart PogpegaBot when it breaks (and so the command isnt abused)
- Gamba with Pogpegas
- Temporary increase in pogpegas when the gfuel message shows up
- Copypasta library
